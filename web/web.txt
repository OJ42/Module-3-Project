The internet is a series of computer groups called "networks" linked together and communicating with the use of routers.
The routers are able to read unique IP addresses (each computer connected to the internet has one) and route request/response actions.
When someone clicks on a link or puts in a URL they want to visit, a request to a server somewhere in the world is sent out and found with the use of the routers.

The URL or domain name is like a nickname for the actual IP address. Once the computer with the correct IP address is found, that computer takes the request and sends out the correct response.
The response can be all kinds of things. Usually the response will come back as HTML code which the browser can read and then display as a string for the user to understand.
